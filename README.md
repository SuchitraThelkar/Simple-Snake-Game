# 🐍 Snake Game using Pygame Zero

This is a classic Snake game implemented in **Python** using the **Pygame Zero** library. It's a simple yet engaging game where the player controls a growing snake that must eat food to grow longer — but avoid crashing into itself!

## 🎮 Game Rules

- Use **arrow keys** to control the snake's direction.
- The snake **wraps around** the screen edges.
- Eating food makes the snake grow.
- If the snake **collides with itself**, the game resets after a short pause.
- Snake color changes to gray on collision to indicate game over.
